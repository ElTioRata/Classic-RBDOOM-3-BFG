In order to make your Doom 3 mod an expansion follow these steps:

1. copy paste the english.lang file (and it's folder) from the base directory to your mod directory

2. Open the english.lang file (mostly recommented notepad++) and add on it's end two new strings:
#str_swf_custom_game: The name of your mod
#str_swf_start_map: The first map to be loaded

3. And thats it. Have fun !!!
