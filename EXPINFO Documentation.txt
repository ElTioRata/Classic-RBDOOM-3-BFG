1. WHAT IS EXPINFO?
----------------------

EXPINFO is a script extension similar to MAPINFO that allow you to set various map/expansion related modifications.
Unlike MAPINFO EXPINFO is more abstract and alot easier to write.
EXPINFO can be used ONLY on DOOM II and it's expansions.

-----------------
2.HOW TO USE IT?
-----------------

EXPINFO can be loaded as a lump like MAPINFO. Also you can load an external file with the .dlc extension.

----------------------
3. CAN I USE MAPINFO?
----------------------

Yes, but it will run under EXPINFO's compatibility mode. Which means that MAPINFO support 
(for now) is only available on DOOM II and still NOT ALL the MAPINFO parameters are supported.

---------------------
4. EXPINFO STRUCTURE
---------------------

The EXPINFO structure goes like that:

EXP #General info about the expansion
max_maps = 33
final_map = 30
save_dir = MYMOD

miniboss = true
sky_tex = SKY3
